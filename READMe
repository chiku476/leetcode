In Java, when you create an int[] array like this:

java
Copy
Edit
int[] map = new int[26];
✅ It is already initialized with zeros by default. So you don't need to do anything extra.

🔍 Explanation:
In Java:

All primitive type arrays (int, long, double, etc.) are initialized to their default values.

For int, the default is 0.

✅ Maximum value of int:
Copy
Edit
2,147,483,647
✅ In powers of 10 (approximate):
Copy
Edit
≈ 2.1 × 10⁹
This is because a 32-bit signed integer ranges from:

Minimum: −2³¹ = −2,147,483,648

Maximum: 2³¹−1 = 2,147,483,647
